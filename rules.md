# Rules of the 100 Days Of FilanTech Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
October 7th, 2022

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at university, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
